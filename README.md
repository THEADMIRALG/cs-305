The purpose of this project was to complete an application for Artemis Financial, a consulting company that develops financial plans such as savings accounts, retirement funds, investments, and insurance. Their application needed to be modernized to meet today’s security standards, so my job was to complete the application via an algorithm cipher and certification, and to make sure there were no vulnerabilities in the application. I think that I did well with finding where the vulnerabilities were stemming from and fixing them without changing too much of the application. Which is good because the company wanted to maintain the same level of security, they had so minimal changes to dependencies was important to try and maintain. One thing that I think I could have done better was not to declare the SAN in my certificate as this should only be done in testing circumstances. I also think my cipher algorithm could’ve used a bit of work to make it more reusable in the future. This project taught me a lot about different ways to deal with vulnerabilities which I will be using in the future. I currently must deal with software vulnerabilities at my job, and it was really good to see different techniques and tools that I could be using within my everyday work.
